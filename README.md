## üß∞ T-Pot Honeypot - Detailed Tool Explanations

**T-Pot** is a comprehensive honeypot platform developed by Deutsche Telekom. It aggregates multiple honeypots and security tools within a Dockerized, easy-to-deploy architecture. The platform is designed to attract, detect, and analyze attacks in real time.

### üîç Honeypots & Tools Included in T-Pot:

| Tool         | Category            | Description |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Dionaea**  | Malware Collection  | Dionaea is a low-interaction honeypot built to collect malware samples. It supports various protocols such as SMB, FTP, HTTP, TFTP, MSSQL, and SIP. Its main purpose is to simulate vulnerable services that attackers frequently target to drop or download malware. |
| **Cowrie**   | SSH/Telnet Honeypot | Cowrie is a medium-interaction honeypot that emulates a real SSH or Telnet server. It allows attackers to log in with weak credentials and interact with a fake file system and shell environment. Cowrie logs attacker commands, session transcripts, and file uploads for forensic analysis. |
| **Conpot**   | ICS/SCADA Emulation | Conpot simulates industrial control systems (ICS) and SCADA environments such as Siemens PLCs. It's designed to mimic critical infrastructure systems, drawing in attackers who target utilities and manufacturing environments. |
| **Honeytrap**| Port Listener       | Honeytrap is a highly configurable honeypot that listens on multiple TCP/UDP ports. It logs connection attempts and can dynamically open ports based on incoming packets. Useful for detecting network reconnaissance and scanning. |
| **Elastic Stack (ELK)** | Log Management | Consists of **Elasticsearch** (data indexing and search), **Logstash** (data processing pipeline), and **Kibana** (interactive dashboard). This trio enables centralized log collection, threat visualization, and analysis of honeypot data in real-time. |
| **Suricata** | Intrusion Detection | Suricata is a high-performance Network IDS/IPS/NSM that inspects network traffic. It detects attacks, port scans, malware traffic, and protocol anomalies. T-Pot uses Suricata to generate alerts and feed them into Elasticsearch. |
| **Portainer**| Docker Management   | A lightweight web-based GUI for managing Docker containers. Portainer provides insights into container health, logs, resource usage, and makes it easy to start/stop honeypot services. |
| **Cockpit**  | Server Dashboard    | A Linux server manager accessed via the web browser. It offers real-time CPU, memory, disk usage, system logs, and terminal access to the host server, simplifying server monitoring and administration. |
